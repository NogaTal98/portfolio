          <p>
            I am Noga Tal, a software engineer from Herzliya. 
            I studied computer science (BSc) at Reichman University, where I built a solid foundation in the field. 
            
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent 1.5 years at Red Hat as a Software Quality Engineer, where I worked with Cypress and JavaScript to create new UI tests from scratch for our product. 
            Additionally, I maintained existing end-to-end tests and developed new features using Ansible. 
            My time at Red Hat also provided me with valuable experience in OpenShift and cloud platforms such as AWS.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy working on private projects using React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Firebase. 
            I have a deep passion for software development and a knack for quickly learning new technologies, which continually fuels my growth and enthusiasm in this ever-evolving field. 
            And when I'm not coding, you can find me debugging my plants â€“ turns out, they don't appreciate being watered on a strict deployment schedule!
